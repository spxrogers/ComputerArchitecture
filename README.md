Projects (all but one) completed throughout the course of Computer Architecture, content posted with permission from instructor with all identifying information removed.

  Overview:
- Project 1: read characters from standard input and if the character is found in the string inside the id file, flip the case, otherwise print as is. Languages used: x86-32 Assembly.

- Project 2: Implement two functions in assembly: 1) Reads in a pointer to a node and returns the length of the node, or -1 if the list cycles, and 2) reverse the order of the list. Languages used: x86-32 Assembly.

- Project 4: Implement a count function in x86 twice, one using a conditional jump and one not, to reason about the impact of performance from instruction selection. Languages used: x86-32 Assembly.

- Project 5: Implement a functional simulator for an 8-bit ISA. Languages used: Java.

- Project 6: Implement a stack architecture simulator. Languages used: C.

- Project 7: Learn about caches and performance by measuring the performance of a matrix transpose. Languages used: C.

- Project 8: Implemented a program that estimates the performace of an x86 processor. Languages used: C.

- Project 9: Implemented a program to estimate cache size and latencies of a processor using dependent load calls. Languages used: C, and x86-32 Assembly.

- Project 10: Implemented virtual memory functions. Only part of the code can be posted due to permissions. Languages used: C.
